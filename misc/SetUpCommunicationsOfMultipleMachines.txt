Firstly, we need to set up the host and network for master and remote machine: 
(For here, we use NUC6i5 for master and manifold52 for remote machine.)


Connect NUC6i5 and manifold52 to the same LAN. 


On NUC6i5:
1)	Set IP address: 192.168.1.15; 
2)	" sudo gedit /etc/hostname " , change hostname into NUC6i5 ;
3)	" sudo gedit /etc/hosts ", add 2 lines like the red square: 
4)	" sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart ";
5)	" sudo apt-get install chrony ";
6)	" sudo apt-get install openssh-server ";
7)	" gedit .bashrc " and add these in the bottom: 
    	" export ROS_HOSTNAME=`hostname`
     	  export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://`hostname`:11311 ";
8)	" source ~/.bashrc ".



On manifold52: 
1)	Set IP address: 192.168.1.52; 
2)	" sudo gedit /etc/hostname " , change hostname into manifold52; 
3)	" sudo gedit /etc/hosts ", add 2 lines as before;
4)	" sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart ";  
5)	" sudo apt-get install chrony ";
6)	" sudo apt-get install openssh-server ";
7)	" gedit .bashrc " and add these in the bottom: 
    	" export ROS_HOSTNAME=`hostname`
	  export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://NUC6i5:11311 " 
	//Note: At this point, NUC6i5 is the master. Should be changed if master is changed. 
8)	" source ~/.bashrc ".
