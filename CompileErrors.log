Symptom:
catkin_make fails with the following error message: 
/opt/ros/indigo/lib/libtf.so: undefined reference to `tf2::BufferCore::_allFramesAsDot(double) const'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

Cause: 
It seems tf2 (http://rosindex.github.io/p/tf2/) is missing when ros-indigo-desktop-full is installed.

Fix: install tf2:
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-tf2
